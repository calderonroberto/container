## High Priority
+ Base events on ThingBroker; but provide ability to run Faye if needed.
+ Tests for uploading files, modified apps models, modified create/modificate forms
+ Add picture upload
+ Document S3W setup (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/paperclip-s3)
+ Create an undeletable demo application already hosted by the container as a demo out of the box
+ AWS works, but it's too expensive. Look for an ftp server (kimberly?)

## Non-High Priority

+ Add authentication to faye server
+ Add authentication to resque web-server
+ click effect on selecting an app through large display

## Missing tests

+ rspec tests for resque workers
+ rspec test for static_pages_spec test; clicking on an application should stage application
