 This application is part of a behavioural study conducted by the Principal Investigator Dr. Sidney Fels (Associate Professor, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia (604) 822-5338) and the Investigator Roberto Calderon ( PhD candidate. Media and Graphics Interdisciplinary Centre. Universtity of British Columbia.) <br>

The research attempts to understand how information and communication technologies (mobile phones, electronics and public displays), social media and gaming are used in social places. The current research has developed a system using large LCD screens, electronics and mobile web applications for social places. To understand how people use these applications and the effects that they have on the communities that use them we will conduct the following procedures:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Ethnographic observations and notes taken by researchers, consisting of observing your usage (1-5 mins daily for 2 months) of technology.</li>
<li>Anonymous logs of your usage of the applications: pages visited, messages, and buttons clicked/tapped.</li>
</ul>
<br>
The data gathered from this experiment will be made anonymous by using a subject number , this will preserve your confidentiality. Identifiable data will be stored securely in a password protected server at the Media and Graphics Interdisciplinary Centre. All data from individual participants will be coded so that their anonymity is protected in any project reports and presentations that result from this experiment. The results of this study will be reported in a PhD thesis and may also be published in conference proceedings, journal articles and books. </br>

As potential benefits, you will gain the ability to interact with members of your local community, strangers and people outside your private social circles. Furthermore, in the future other people and communities might benefit from what we learn in this study. By participating in our research you are at risk of having to confront strangers and interact with technologies you are not familiar with.<br> 
Researchers might record video or take photographs. All video and photographs will be made anonymous by covering your face entirely with a black circle. Only researchers under this project will have access to the data. Video will be used only by researchers to observe your natural interaction with technologies (mobile phones, and public displays). Photographs might be disseminated in scientific publications, in which case, researchers will be made anonymous by covering your face (and other features that make you recognizable) with black circles.<br><br>

If you have any concerns or complaints about your rights as a research participant and/or your experiences while participating in this study, contact the Research Participant Complaint Line in the UBC Office of Research Services at 604-822-8598 or if long distance e-mail RSIL@ors.ubc.ca or call toll free 1-877-822-8598.
